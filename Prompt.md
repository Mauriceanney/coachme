-------------------
Boilerplate start
--------------------
Hi,
Please create a detailed implementation plan for the following:
At the moment, we have a boilerplate project, but what we actually want to do is replace it with an actual Saas application that allows users to upload images of themselves, their friends, their family, or even their pets. This app will then use an AI model to convert the subjects in those images to plushies.
This means that our app needs to have a beautiful landing page where it shows the user the end result so we could show a before and after image and some SEO-optimised text to promote the product. 
Users should also be able to sign into the application and from the dashboard they should be able to generate images. These images will be stored to their gallery.
This app should also have public-facing documentation on using the application along with all legal documents like privacy pages etc.
At this stage I do not want to focus on the back-end logic. 
We are only focusing on the UI components and nothing else. 
This will give us a feel for the user experience before moving on to adding the actual back-end logic. 
Please remember to ask any clarifying questions during this process.

---------------------
Implementation plan
----------------------

Please create a subfolder in the specs folder for this specific feature.
Within the folder, create two files: requirements.md and implementation-plan.md.
The requirements file should contain our initial requirements, 
with any other functional and non-functional requirements as well as acceptance criteria.
For the implementation plan, 
I needed to create a detailed implementation plan that is split into separate phases. 
Each phase should contain an actionable list of tasks with checkboxes so that we can track our progress. At this stage, do not include any unit or end-to-end testing.

Go ahead and Start implement phases 1. Make sure to Mark the tasks as complete once you're done.

global(at the end of feature)
-----------------------------
Hey there, we've just implemented all of the phases for
this feature. Now, what I want you to do is to review the implementation - the actual coded
solution -and see if we missed anything. Please try to identify any gaps or any issues related
to the implementation not following Next.js and React best practises. Use your web search tool
to look up any up-to-date documentation related to any libraries or features used in our
application.

solution. So, it's possible that there might be code duplication or duplicate functions or components. 
As part of your review, try to see if there were any duplicate files or functions created or duplicate components as part of this implementation.

Please run lint, type check and npm run build. Resolve any issues.

Let's create an implementation plan for the following:
At the moment,
our application is using dummy user data. Now we already
have Better Auth set up in this
application, so let's replace all this
stubbed data with the actual user data from thę database and from Better Auth. This includes things like the user button and
I the Sign
In
button in the top navigation and the users profile page.

Please reference the Better Auth documentation in the docs folder, or use tools like Context to retrieve up-to-date documentation on setting up and using Better Auth. \
